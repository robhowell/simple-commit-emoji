### Background
I love the idea of using emoji in commit messages, but I haven't found a set out there so far that feels quite right to me. The list above is a minimal set of emoji that can easily be used to improve the readability of your commit messages.

### Setup
Add each of the emojis as a text expansion shortcut: on Mac OS X you can use the built-in Mac text expansion functionality (within System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Text), on other platforms you can use a tool such as TextExpander.

## Usage
Prefix source control commit messages using the emoji above, and combine emoji where appropriate.
