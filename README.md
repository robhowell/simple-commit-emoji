A simple set of emoji to improve readability of source control commit messages

I love the idea of using emoji in commit messages, but I haven't found a set out there so far that feels quite right to me. The list below is a minimal set of emoji that can easily be used to improve the readability of your commit messages.

Note: If you like things to be super-convenient (like I do), then I recommend adding each of the emojis to a text expansion tool such as TextExpander or using the built-in Mac text expansion functionality within System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Text.
